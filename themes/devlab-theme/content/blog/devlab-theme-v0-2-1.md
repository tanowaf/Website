DevLab Theme `v0.2.1` tightens the `v0.2` foundation with more predictable optional features, safer links and fewer compatibility branches.

## Breaking configuration change

DevLab Theme `v0.2.1` removes the flat configuration aliases retained from `0.1.x`. Sites already using `extra.devlab.*` require no changes. Sites still using flat fields under `[extra]` must update them before upgrading; otherwise those values are ignored and the affected features use their defaults.

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `logo_text`, `footer_text`                      | `devlab.brand.logo_text`, `devlab.brand.footer_text`                      |
| `nav_links`                                     | `devlab.navigation.links`                                                 |
| `docs_section`, `docs_path`, `get_started_path` | `devlab.docs.section`, `devlab.docs.path`, `devlab.docs.get_started_path` |
| `blog_path`                                     | `devlab.blog.path`                                                        |
| `theme_default`, `theme_toggle`                 | `devlab.appearance.default_mode`, `devlab.appearance.show_toggle`         |
| `search_index`                                  | `devlab.search.index`                                                     |
| `og_image`                                      | `devlab.seo.og_image`                                                     |

Existing `home_*` homepage fields, `extra.labels` and interface labels remain unchanged.

## Highlights

- Navigation can be empty or contain only the sections a site actually uses; search and the color-mode toggle remain independent.
- Docs navigation, overview trees and previous or next links now pass through transparent sections without exposing structural placeholders.
- Mobile anchor targets stay visible below the sticky header, and drawer transitions no longer interfere with focus restoration.
- Internal paths still respect Zola's base URL, while absolute, protocol-relative, fragment, query, email and telephone links keep their original form.
- Code blocks preserve their layout without JavaScript, including long lines and copy-button spacing.
- Page and section title overrides once again flow into the final document title without duplicating SEO logic.
- Tagged installation examples are pinned to the release, and CI verifies that a release tag matches `theme.toml`.

## Compatibility

DevLab Theme `v0.2.1` requires Zola `0.22.1` or newer and remains fully Zola-native: no Node.js, npm or external frontend runtime is required.
